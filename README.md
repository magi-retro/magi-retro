## Magi history

Many people think that Magi coin started as Magi coin.
That's not right. Magi coin had a completly different codebase than the one it's using right now.
Magi coin was, back in the day **Magicoin**. That's why you see this weird name *Coin of the magi*.

You could actually exchange or swap those old Magiccoin coins to Magi coins.
